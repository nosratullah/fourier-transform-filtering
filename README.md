## Fourier-transform:

Fourier transform is basically the same thing as convolution is, but with only a few differences.
Instead of the simple line kernel, in Fourier transform the kernel is a sin wave with a specific frequency
Instead of just only one kernel, in Fourier transform we use many kernels (sine waves with different frequencies) to cover a range of frequencies.

The above figure is just a simple convolution to show how Fourier-transform works, but to get precise result we have to consider technical details and calculate the convolution of a much wider range of sin waves with different frequencies.
The focus of this post is on filtering frequencies and why we need it. And Iâ€™m sure you can find dozens of good tutorials on how to take Fourier transform of your data/signals. here is a good source to find out more:

## Filtering:
Having multiple sin waves creating one signal is common when you deal with signals. For instance, while your brain does a task, different regions in your brain working together to achieve that task. Those different areas of your brain are usually oscillating in different frequencies and the result of it creates a complicated signal which you see in the EEG signal.
As a neuroscience student, I have to consider these cooperations and to study only one area of the brain, I may need to filter out other sources. But these technic has a wide application in telecommunication, smoothing data by sub-pressing noises and in general studying any time-series which has periodic sources as well. Talking of noise, as we saw above the convolution of a simple line shape kernel with a signal also smooth the signal and remove the sharp edges of the signal. But convolution is not the best method of reducing the noise when it comes to perfection.
