## Fourier-transform:

Fourier transform is basically the same thing as convolution is, but with only a few differences.
Instead of the simple line kernel, in Fourier transform the kernel is a sin wave with a specific frequency
Instead of just only one kernel, in Fourier transform we use many kernels (sine waves with different frequencies) to cover a range of frequencies.

The above figure is just a simple convolution to show how Fourier-transform works, but to get precise result we have to consider technical details and calculate the convolution of a much wider range of sin waves with different frequencies.
The focus of this post is on filtering frequencies and why we need it. And Iâ€™m sure you can find dozens of good tutorials on how to take Fourier transform of your data/signals. here is a good source to find out more:
