## Fourier-transform:

Fourier transform is basically the same thing as convolution is, but with only a few differences.
Instead of the simple line kernel, in Fourier transform the kernel is a sin wave with a specific frequency
Instead of just only one kernel, in Fourier transform we use many kernels (sine waves with different frequencies) to cover a range of frequencies.
