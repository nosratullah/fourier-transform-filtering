# Convolution

## Dot product:
Dot product which is the basic step of convolution is a very simple equation. â€¨To compute the dot product we simply multiply each element of one vector (array) by the corresponding element in the other vector:

Here  is the the length of the array and  is the index number of array  and .
## Convolution:
Convolution is an extension of dot-product, in which the dot-product is computed repeatedly over time. We have two vector in convolution, One is the signal itself, and the other is the kernel.
